<p><b>PART 1: AMATERASU</b></p>

<p><b>Chapter 1: I’ll Start Trying Tomorrow</b></p>

<p>“Sasami-saaaan~~.”</p>

<p>My brother was calling me. (1)</p>

<p>I flipped my laptop screen closed, and took a nice, long stretch.</p>

<p>The date was February fourteenth.</p>

<p>St. Valentine’s Day.</p>

<p>“Sasami-saaaan~~ It’s morning~~.”</p>

<p>My brother casually came into the room.</p>

<p>He was wearing the suit he usually wore to work (he was a school teacher at a local school) and he used his briefcase to hide his face.</p>

<p>My brother never liked getting his face seen.</p>

<p>I really wished he just went to work without bothering me first though.</p>

<p>I was feeling pretty sluggish while I thought about that, so my body fell sideways.</p>

<p>“Sasami-saaaan~~.”</p>

<p>My brother approached me with suspicious motions, and began to give me his usual speech.</p>

<p>“It’s morning. Early Monday morning. Please try to go to school today.”</p>

<p>“Can’t.”</p>

<p>That was the first thing I said to my brother that morning.</p>

<p>But my brother didn’t seem to mind, and just kept his gaze on me as I lay there.</p>

<p>“Sasami-san. You’re already sixteen. You’re finally a high school student, so how about trying to enjoy high school life for at least a day?”</p>

<p>My brother let out a sigh, and set down the tray he was holding in one hand next to me.</p>

<p>“You must be hungry. I made some breakfast for you.”</p>

<p>“Mm.”</p>

<p>I lifted my head up and looked at what was in my brother’s hands.</p>

<p>On the tray rested sandwiches that had been cut into rectangles.</p>

<p>The sandwiches were made with bananas, kiwis, strawberries, and other fruits, with fresh cream tying everything together. It was quite a colorful sandwich.</p>

<p>“Oniichan.”</p>

<p>Certainly, I did feel a bit hungry, but I stayed lying there.</p>

<p>I just made a few chomping motions with my mouth.</p>

<p>“Feed me.”</p>

<p>“You’re such a baby, Sasami-san. You’re already sixteen.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t feed me, I’m gonna starve to death.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I have to then.”</p>

<p>After he had fed me around three of the sandwiches, I felt satisfied.</p>

<p>“Oniichan can have the rest if he wants.”</p>

<p>There was still quite a bit left.</p>

<p>But my brother shook his head.</p>

<p>“I already finished eating. I’ll just leave this here then…”</p>

<p>My brother wrapped the sandwiches up, plate and all.</p>

<p>“If you’re hungry when it’s lunchtime, please help yourself.”</p>

<p>Well, I’m pretty sure I’d be sleeping at noon anyways.</p>

<p>“Would you like something to drink? You ate that in a weird position, so are you sure nothing stuck in your throat?”</p>

<p>“I’m fine. More importantly, you’re going to be late, oniichan.”</p>

<p>Teachers had to wake up early in the morning. They really didn’t have the time to deal with their hikikomori little sisters. (2)</p>

<p>I was satisfied now that my stomach was full, and I felt myself getting sleepy.</p>

<p>“Leave me alone. I’m going to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Okay, okay.”</p>

<p>My brother stroked the top of my head, his hand twirling through my hair.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m off to school then. If Sasami-san feels like it, you should come to school even in the middle of the day. I’d welcome you with open arms any time.”</p>

<p>My brother headed out of my room, although he seemed sad that we were parting.</p>

<p>He headed out of my large yet cramped, peaceful room.</p>

<p>Into that outside world which overflowed with other people and absurd happenings.</p>

<p>“I’m leaving, Sasami-san.”</p>

<p>“Oniichan.”</p>

<p>As I fought my drowsiness, I suddenly remembered something and reached out a hand.</p>

<p>Ah right. I completely forgot. I had gone through the trouble of ordering it too.</p>

<p>Today was February 14th, after all.</p>

<p>I fiddled around with the mail order box, and after tearing open the vinyl wrapping, I took the contents from the box.</p>

<p>It was a small rectangular box, wrapped with fairly plain wrapping paper.</p>

<p>“Here. A bentou for you.” (3)</p>

<p>It would be annoying to throw the bentou to him, so I just held it up instead.</p>

<p>“Hm? What is it?”</p>

<p>My brother came back to my side, took the box, and stared at it intently.</p>

<p>“I already told you, it s a bentou for you.”</p>

<p>I rubbed my eyes. Ugh, I seriously was sleepy.</p>

<p>“Have a nice day, oniichan.”</p>

<p>Today, I wouldn’t try hard either.</p>

<p>TRANSLATOR’S NOTES</p>

<p>(1) Just a note about the convention I will use: I am going to use “brother” in narration and “oniichan” in dialogue or dialogue-like narration. I would use oniichan everywhere, but it sounds pretty awkward when used in normal narration to me.</p>

<p>(2) A hikikomori is a social recluse, someone who refuses to go outside and socialize. There’s actually a lot more to that word, but in the interest of keeping things simple I’ll just say that much.</p>

<p>(3) A lunch box.</p>
